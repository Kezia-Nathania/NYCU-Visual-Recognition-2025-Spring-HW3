## Introduction 
The objective of this homework is to detect and segment individual cells while correctly classifying each instance using Mask R-CNN. To enhance the model's robustness and accuracy, the study incorporates both training data augmentation and test-time augmentation (TTA). The effectiveness of these techniques is evaluated through a series of experiments, highlighting their contribution to improved segmentation performance.
